Process to create Spring IOC
	
	1) Create Bean Class - Model - POJO
	2) Create Xml File - Create a bean to construct an object of a class
	3) Create Demo Class - It contains Spring way i.e. main class
	4) Load jar files - Dependencies
	5) Run - Execute
	
Spring IOC have two containers - These two are API's
	1) BeanFactory - It will construct an object of a class with request - class is XmlBeanFactory
	2) ApplicationContext - It will construct an object of a class without any request - Class is ClassPathXmlApplicationContext
	
	-> Features of an IOC Container
		1) Creating the objects
		2) Managing their complete life cycle
		3) Wiring them together
		4) Configuring - Configure your objects in a xml file i.e. set the key value pair to set value for an attributes
		
Dependency Injection
	Spring Way: XML | IOC
		Dependency Injection can be achieved by using either
